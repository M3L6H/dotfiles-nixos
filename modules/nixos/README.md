# [Steam](/modules/nixos/steam.nix)

The steam module comes with a few additional tools/utils for improving the
gaming experience.

Consult [prontodb](https://www.protondb.com/) to evaluate comaptibility with
Linux.

## Game Scope

Can be helpful if the game has issues with scaling/resolution. Simply prepend
it to the launch options of the game in the game's general options.

## Game Mode Run

Can improve game performance by requesting a set of temporary optimizations to
be applied to the game and the OS.
